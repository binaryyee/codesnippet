# CodeSnips
CodeSnips is a cloud-based application designed for developers to store, organize, and share commonly used code components. Similar to Pastebin, CodeSnips is built with HTML, CSS, and JS in the frontend and Django, a Python web framework, in the backend. With CodeSnips, you can easily access and share your frequently used code snippets from any device with internet access.

## Usage
To use CodeSnips on your local machine, you can easily fork this project and follow the below instructions:

1. Ensure that you have Python 3+ version, Django, Pip3, and Widget installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the codesnips/ directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Type python3 manage.py runserver 8000 to start the app on your local server.
4. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/ to access the app.

Once you access the app, you will see a clean and user-friendly interface where you can easily create, store, and organize your code snippets. You can create new snippets, edit existing ones, and even add labels to help you keep everything organized.

## Features
CodeSnips comes with several features that can help you improve your coding experience, including:

- **Syntax highlighting:** CodeSnips automatically highlights syntax for over 150 programming languages, making it easier to read and understand your code snippets.
- **Sharing:** With CodeSnips, you can easily share your code snippets with others. You can share snippets via a unique URL or even embed them directly into your website.
- **Collaboration:** CodeSnips allows multiple users to work together on a single snippet, making it easier to collaborate with others on a project.
- **Searching and Filtering:** You can easily search for specific code snippets or filter them based on labels or language.
